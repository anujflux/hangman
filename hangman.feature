Feature: A game of hangman

  Scenario: Start a new game of hangman

  Scenario: Indication of how many letters there are in the word that are to be guessed

  Scenario: I want to submit one letter guesses and be told whether my guess is either in the word, not in the word, or already guessed

  Scenario: I want the game to handle bad input (like numbers, symbols, and letters I've previously guessed) gracefully and with an appropriate error message so that I am not punished unduly for mistakes

  Scenario: I want to see the letters I've guessed correctly revealed on the hidden word that I am trying to guess so that I can guess the word more readily

  Scenario: I want to see the letters I've guessed incorrectly so that I don't guess the same wrong letter again

  Scenario: I would like to see how many lives are remaining

  Scenario: there should be 1 life deducted every time I make an incorrect guess of a letter that I have not already guessed

  Scenario: I want the game to end when I have run out of lives

  Scenario: I want the game to end when I have guessed the full word

  Scenario: When I lose the game I want to see the word I was trying to guess

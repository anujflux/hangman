User behavior
- Start a new game
- Select a letter
- Continue to the next level
- Quit the game


Questions
- How many lives does the user have ? 
- Word list - where do I get this from ? 
- How many levels ? 
- Are there any difficuilty levels ?

------------------------

--> Start simple in the word lists , no spaces or special characters etc (Simplest way to achive the result)
--> Use sample(p1) public instead of Random class
--> Use constant instead of @word_list (Learn about variables)
--> select_word is doing too many things and the name is misleading (ONE METHOD ONE THING)
--> Difference between Array.new and []
--> Use `map` for select_word (Ruby way)
--> Difference between print and puts

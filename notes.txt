User behavior
- Start a new game
- Select a letter
- Continue to the next level
- Quit the game


Questions
- How many lives does the user have ?
- Word list - where do I get this from ?
- How many levels ?
- Are there any difficuilty levels ?

MAX_LIVES = 5
WORDLIST = []

def start_game
end

def select_word

def user_select_letter
end

def letter_in_word

------------------------

--> (DONE) Start simple in the word lists , no spaces or special characters etc (Simplest way to achive the result)
--> (DONE) Use sample(p1) public instead of Random class
--> (DONE) Use constant instead of @word_list (Learn about variables)
--> (DONE) select_word is doing too many things and the name is misleading (ONE METHOD ONE THING)
--> (DONE) Difference between Array.new and []
--> (DONE) Use `map` for select_word (Ruby way)

  # get_user_guess is doing a bit more but leave it for now. 
  # Finish simple use case of the game
  # Five lines in a method
    # Does my method do a single thing ?
  # Object Oriented game -
  #   Game, Round - Games can have multiple rounds and player can play multiple games. For eg, select_word belongs to the Game and not the round
  #   Interaction - Displaying messages to the user
